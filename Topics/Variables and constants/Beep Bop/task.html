<p>Suppose you have developed a robot that follows simple commands in the following order: <code class="java">Up</code>, <code class="java">Down</code>, <code class="java">Left</code> and <code class="java">Right</code>.</p>
<p>However, it doesn't follow these orders at all! Could you fix the block of constants in the code below?</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b>  Don't forget that the constant name should be on the left. </p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
